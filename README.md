# World_Weather_Analysis
An analysis on the weather anywhere in the world for hotel choosing for potential clients.

## This analysis is composed of three main codes/purposes.
1. A search for random cities around the globe using random coordinates and citiPy.
2. Using the previous city database and an API call to OpenWeather a new database with weather description is created. With this information a filter based on the preferred temperatures is made (according to clients preferences) and a new database is made with Hotels near those preferred cities (using Geoapify Places API).
3. Lastly 4 close by destinations were chosen and a vacation route was made using in real road information (courtesy of Geoapify Route API)
